# fcc-pomodoro-255

The **[Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock)** Certification by **[FCC](https://freecodecamp.org)** includes a test to develop a Javascript clock to be used in a simple implementation of the duties load Pomodoro 25 methodology. It is my version submitted.


## IMPORTANT, THE FCC TEST FAILS USING A REACT VERSION OVER 17.2

The **[FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)** test of this piece was a headache. I made a super-fast solution, but when the test runs only achieves 15/29. 
And what happens? I used React 18.1. Outside the test, all user stories run well. Then, for the next two weeks, I reviewed a lot of theories to handle timers, fit the gaps, enhance performance, and rewrite times.

All middle approaches were clean. The code and the accuracy were perfect. 
As a result, I got the same fucking: 15/29.

Then, I downgraded the React version, and all tests were a success!!!

### Conclusion: 
The **[FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)** test for **[25 x 5 clock](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW)** doesn't support **React 18**

Happy coding, and enjoy my approach.
